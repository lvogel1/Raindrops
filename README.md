Raindrops
=========


As of now (12/29), a tiny plant moves around the bottom of the screen. Every # of caught drops, the plant will get bigger. Eventually, it will reach the top of the screen and the game will end. :D

If 5 herbicides land on the plant, it dies.

Game is finished. :)

Bugs: Plant doesn't catch at top because it isn't circular.
