Raindrops
=========


As of now (12/13), the game has raindrops falling and you catch it with a circle. There's a score and a timer that increases.


Overall plan is to make a tiny plant that moves around the screen. Every 5-10 caught drops, the plant will get bigger. Eventually, it will reach the top of the screen and the game will end. :)
