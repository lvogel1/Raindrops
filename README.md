Raindrops
=========


<<<<<<< HEAD
As of now (12/29), a tiny plant moves around the bottom of the screen. Every # of caught drops, the plant will get bigger. Eventually, it will reach the top of the screen and the game will end. :D

If 5 herbicides land on the plant, it dies.

Game is finished. :)

Bugs:
1. Plant doesn't catch at top because it isn't circular.
2. Font in gameover screen is weird. Not sure why.  -  fixed
3. Music lags awkwardly towards the middle of the game.
4. Every odd time the game is opened, the instructions stop at the middle of the page. Every even time, the instructions work fine.

As of now (12/13), the game has raindrops falling and you catch it with a circle. There's a score counter and a timer that increases.


Overall plan is to make a tiny plant that moves around the bottom of the screen. Every 5-10 caught drops, the plant will get bigger. Eventually, it will reach the top of the screen and the game will end. :D
